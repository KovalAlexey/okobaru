This Street-Custom Edition kit from Tamiya was released in 2014, though it was first introduced by the company back in 1997. This iconic car is available in various versions, including 5-door sedan, racing, stock, and custom versions, also represented by other brands. According to ScaleMates, models of this Nissan have been produced since 1979 (10 years after the real car‚Äôs release). The Tamiya Street-Custom Edition includes Watanabe wheels, an additional driver figure with accessories, and photo-etched parts. All details are clearly molded and well-detailed, matching Tamiya‚Äôs high product quality. The kit includes full engine detailing and an opening hood.\nPrevious Nextsads Assembly # The assembly was enjoyable and smooth: all parts fit together nicely, are well-detailed, and the lines are precisely printed. The instructions are also straightforward. The kit includes optional engine parts (racing and stock), along with a photo-etched radiator that can be installed under the bumper. Initially, I installed it, but it didn‚Äôt look quite right since it protruded significantly below and didn‚Äôt align with the car‚Äôs overall style, so I removed it after assembly. Following the instructions and assembling carefully will lead to great results. I encountered a minor issue with the hood: the instructions suggested securing it with masking tape during assembly, but I likely didn‚Äôt do a pre-fit, so after painting, the hood doesn‚Äôt fully close. This can be corrected and repainted, but for now, I‚Äôve left it as is. The kit also includes metal stickers for extra detailing. The front and rear emblems can be added as decals or photo-etching ‚Äî I chose photo-etching for a more realistic look. The photo-etched license plate frame (a plastic one is also included) looks great with transparent number decals.\nPainting # When I bought this kit, I didn‚Äôt have much enthusiasm for it, to be honest, I bought it for a good price. Therefore, I didn‚Äôt want to complicate the painting process too much. The main color for this model is Vallejo Metal Color: Pale Burnt Metal (77.704), which I used to paint the body, engine, and parts of the exhaust system. To make the metallic paint look different on various parts, I used different primers: gray Vallejo for the body and black for the engine and exhaust system, applying varying numbers of layers. I managed to achieve a pleasant gray metallic finish on the body, covered with 2-3 coats of Mr. Color GX100 lacquer. The window frames and chrome details were painted with Tamiya X-11 chrome marker. The suspension parts were dry-brushed with ICM Silver. The interior was painted in a two-tone scheme‚Äîblack and brown, using Vallejo acrylics. For weathering, I used Tamiya black wash and their weathering powder to add oil stains and rust effects.\nHistorical Background # The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R, also known as ‚ÄúHakosuka‚Äù (a blend of ‚Äúhako‚Äù meaning ‚Äúbox‚Äù and ‚Äúsuka‚Äù from ‚ÄúSkyline‚Äù), was introduced in 1969 as a high-performance sports car targeted at the Japanese racing market. Equipped with a 2.0-liter S20 inline-six engine producing 160 horsepower, it quickly achieved over 50 wins in Japanese racing within its first three years.\nThe boxy, aggressive design gave it a unique look, which became iconic in Japanese car culture. Only 1,945 units of GT-R sedans and coupes were produced, making it rare and highly valuable among collectors. Its style influenced car enthusiasts and modders, who still admire the ‚ÄúHakosuka‚Äù design.\nThis model was the first to carry the ‚ÄúGT-R‚Äù badge, paving the way for future racing models from Nissan. Although production ended in 1972, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 with the release of the Skyline R32, establishing the GT-R legacy as a symbol of Japanese engineering and performance.\nConclusion # I somewhat underestimated this kit from Tamiya. It‚Äôs very well-made, high-quality, and detailed. The contents of this kit are among the most complete, even including an additional figure. I should have spent more time on it and done a higher-quality job. I recommend it, though perhaps not as a first kit (I‚Äôm sure it can turn out great on the first try, but the quality may not be fully appreciated). Careful work with photo-etching and thorough painting of all parts will yield an excellent and realistic model. I highly recommend it and may even assemble another variation of this beautiful car.\n","date":"4 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/car-blog/nissan-2000-gtr/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Nissan 2000 GT-R by Tamiya","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"Welcome to my blog, where I share my passion for scale modeling, miniatures, and other hobbies that inspire me.

However, it feels like the molds for the parts were created in the ‚Äô90s or even earlier. This is evident from the fact that the clear parts for the windows, as well as the interior ‚Äútub,‚Äù are made as single pieces. The quality of the internal panel lines is poor and barely visible. Additionally, the chrome moldings lack grooves for proper positioning on the body. Although the kit may not appear very detailed at first glance (without an engine or a high-quality interior), the final result looks quite realistic. If assembled and painted correctly, the outcome will be excellent.\nFor those seeking maximum realism and detail, resin detail sets are available from USCP, nd modification videos for this kit can be found on YouTube.\nPrevious Nextsads Assembly # The building process for this Hasegawa BMW 2002 Tii kit was straightforward. As mentioned earlier, the interior ‚Äúbath‚Äù was a single piece, which simplified assembly but left much to be desired in terms of accuracy and realism. I assembled the model almost ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù for simplicity but aimed to make it as clean as possible.\nThe body shell fit well with minimal sanding or adjustments needed. However, the chrome moldings required extra care due to the lack of positioning grooves, so I relied on reference images to ensure accurate placement. The suspension and undercarriage were assembled easily, with the engine already molded into the chassis. To highlight the detailing, it‚Äôs best to paint the engine, specifically its oil pan, in a separate color, and also to accent the wheel arches in a contrasting color. This results in a detailed model with eye-catching elements. Overall, while Japanese and some European model manufacturers may lack complete engine detailing, they compensate with quality parts that yield a realistic and engaging look.\nPainting # For painting, I used various types of paint (water-based acrylic, lacquer paints, and enamels).\nMr. Color 100 Wine Red for the body, applied over Vallejo black primer. Seats - Vallejo Model Color: Leather Brown (70.871) and Vallejo Game Color: Elfic Flesh (72.098) for the interior. Body clear coating - 2-3 layers of Mr. Color GX 100. Tamiya X-11 (enamel) for chrome details. My favorite Vallejo acrylic metallic - Metal Color: Pale Burnt Metal (77.704) for the engine and exhaust. All weathering effects were applied to the underside of the car, including oil stains, yellow rust, black and brown washes, all from Tamiya. Using the dry brush technique (silver metallic) over black primer highlighted the metallic parts of the car. For this, I use budget ICM Silver. Once satisfied with the result, I cover the part with semi-gloss varnish, giving a realistic look to the suspension, fuel tank, and other components of the car‚Äôs underside.\nI polish the body lightly, with gentle wet sanding using fine-grit sandpaper, followed by polishing with Tamiya Polishing Compound Fine. I‚Äôm still improving my polishing and detailing skills, so I don‚Äôt spend much time on this. Occasionally, I sand through to the primer‚Ä¶ Besides, it‚Äôs rare to see cars polished to a mirror finish on the streets. In my opinion, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to weather the underside and polish the body to a shine‚Ä¶ Either make it perfect or make it ‚Äúrealistic.‚Äù\nHistorical Background # The BMW 2002 is a key model that helped establish BMW‚Äôs reputation for producing sporty, driver-focused cars. It came about when BMW\u0026rsquo;s product planner Helmut Werner B√∂nsch and M10 engine designer Alex von Falkenhausen both modified their 1600-2 cars with 2.0-liter engines. When they realized this, they submitted a proposal to the board, which aligned with American importer Max Hoffman\u0026rsquo;s request for a sportier model for the U.S. market, leading to the creation of the BMW 2002.\nThe 2002 came in several versions, including the base model with 100 PS and the more powerful 2002 ti, which produced 120 PS. In 1971, the ti was replaced by the fuel-injected 2002 tii, which boasted 130 PS and a top speed of 185 km/h. Convertible and Touring versions were also available, offering flexibility for different drivers.\nThe 2002 Turbo, launched in 1973, was Europe‚Äôs first turbocharged production car, generating 170 PS and a top speed of 211 km/h. Despite being launched during the oil crisis, it became a legend for its performance and distinctive design, featuring flared arches and motorsport stripes, with only 1,672 units produced.\nConclusion # The Hasegawa BMW 2002 Tii model is a well-designed kit that offers a satisfying assembly experience and excellent results, despite its dated design. Although it consists of relatively few parts and has some drawbacks, it can be built into a classy, realistic model. Overall, this is a great kit that rewards patience and creativity, with a straightforward assembly and minimal fit issues, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced modelers alike.\n","date":"1 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/car-blog/bmw-2002-tii/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"BMW 2002 tii (Late Version) by Hasegawa","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/european/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"European","type":"tags"},{"content":" Disclaimer # This section is still in development üòå I like the idea of assembling and painting miniatures for wargames like Warhammer 40k or Age of Sigmar.
