This particular version—the “Comic Version”—mimics the black-and-white appearance of the original manga panels. This is a well-made kit with excellent engineering and part fit. Many builders report minimal cleanup, crisp panel lines, and precision in bumper and body alignment. Reddit users praise the \u0026ldquo;separate bumpers construction method\u0026rdquo; and working pop-up headlights as highlights of the assembly experience\nFrom my experience:\nBody panels and bumpers align tightly with no filler needed\nHeadlights are molded closed but fit cleanly—no shifting or gaps\nPlastic is softish but well-molded; sharper sprue gates than other brands\nPrevious Next 🎯 Build Tips # Dry-fit suspension first – Even with excellent fit, the low ride height can push joins apart if glued untested. A light cement dab secures parts without fuss.\nMasking the \u0026ldquo;panda\u0026rdquo; scheme – Use sharp tape and multiple thin layers. Panel shading lines are raised, so mask just above them for clean white/black separation.\nWhite primer boosts contrast – Your choice of Mr. Hobby alcohol-based white primer was ideal, helping black lines pop and reducing paint layers needed.\nUse decal softener – Comic decals are thick; setting solution helps them mold to curves, especially over rear fender areas.\nSimplify interior painting – A brown interior reflects the anime’s palette, and sticking to matte/semi-gloss finishes is both accurate and fuss-free.\nPainting # When I bought this kit, I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about building it—honestly, I got it mainly because it was a great deal. So, I didn’t plan to go deep into details during painting. For the main color of this model, I chose Vallejo Metal Color: Pale Burnt Metal (77.704), which I used for the body, engine, and parts of the exhaust system. To achieve a different metallic look on various parts, I used different primers: Vallejo gray for the body and black for the engine and exhaust, also applying varying numbers of layers. This resulted in a pleasant gray metallic on the body, which I cover with 2–3 layers of Mr. Color GX100 clear coat. The window frames and chrome parts were painted with a Tamiya X-11 marker. Suspension parts were “dry brushed” using ICM Silver. The interior was done in a two-tone scheme—black and brown Vallejo acrylic. For weathering, I applied Tamiya black wash and their powder to create effects of oil stains and traces of rust.\nHistorical Background # The Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno was produced from 1983 to 1987 and became iconic in Japan’s street racing scene due to its lightweight chassis, rear-wheel-drive layout, and balanced handling. It wasn’t a fast car by modern standards, but it was precise—and that made it perfect for mountain roads.\nThe car gained legendary status thanks to the manga and anime series Initial D, where teenage driver Takumi Fujiwara uses it to deliver tofu and unknowingly becomes one of the most skilled street racers on Mount Akina. Over time, the AE86 became a symbol of grassroots motorsport and drift culture, influencing a whole generation of drivers and enthusiasts.\nEven today, the AE86 is celebrated in games like Gran Turismo and Forza, and it remains a cult favorite among tuners and collectors.\nConclusion # This kit is a pleasure to build. Fit and finish are excellent, and it requires minimal modification or cleanup. The unique visual style offers a welcome break from traditional hyper-realistic models and makes for a standout shelf piece—especially for fans of Initial D or stylized manga kits.\nDespite its simple curbside construction, the model offers enough detail and style to be satisfying even for experienced builders. I highly recommend this kit to anyone looking to build something different but meaningful.\n","date":"28 Jun 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/car-blog/toyota-trueno-ae86/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Toyota Trueno AE86 by Aoshima","type":"posts"},{"content":"Welcome to my blog, where I share my passion for scale modeling, miniatures, and other hobbies that inspire me.

This Street-Custom Edition kit by Tamiya was released in 2014 but was originally introduced by the company back in 1997. This iconic car is available in various versions, including a 5-door sedan, racing, and custom versions, also offered by other brands. According to ScaleMates, models of this Nissan have been produced since 1979 (a decade after the real car’s debut). Tamiya’s Street-Custom Edition version includes Watanabe wheels, an additional driver figure with accessories, and photo-etched details. All parts are crisply molded and highly detailed, reflecting Tamiya’s high-quality standards. The kit features a highly detailed engine and an opening hood.\nPrevious Next Assembly # The assembly process was enjoyable: all parts fit perfectly, are of high quality, and the lines are sharply printed. The instructions are also clear and leave no questions. The kit includes optional engine parts (racing and standard), as well as a photo-etched radiator that can be mounted under the bumper. I initially installed it, but it looked a bit out of place as it extended too far beneath the bumper, so I removed it after assembly. Following the instructions and assembling the model carefully yields an impressive result.\nThere was a minor issue with the hood during the build: the instructions suggested securing it with masking tape during assembly, but I likely missed a preliminary fitting step, so after painting, the hood doesn’t fully close. This can be fixed and repainted, but for now, I’m leaving it as is. The kit also includes metal stickers for added realism. The front and rear badges can be installed as decals or with photo-etched options—I chose the photo-etched ones. The metal license plate frame (a plastic one is also included) looks very striking with the clear decal for the number.\nPainting # When I bought this kit, I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about building it—honestly, I got it mainly because it was a great deal. So, I didn’t plan to go deep into details during painting. For the main color of this model, I chose Vallejo Metal Color: Pale Burnt Metal (77.704), which I used for the body, engine, and parts of the exhaust system. To achieve a different metallic look on various parts, I used different primers: Vallejo gray for the body and black for the engine and exhaust, also applying varying numbers of layers. This resulted in a pleasant gray metallic on the body, which I cover with 2–3 layers of Mr. Color GX100 clear coat. The window frames and chrome parts were painted with a Tamiya X-11 marker. Suspension parts were “dry brushed” using ICM Silver. The interior was done in a two-tone scheme—black and brown Vallejo acrylic. For weathering, I applied Tamiya black wash and their powder to create effects of oil stains and traces of rust.\nHistorical Background # The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R, also known as “Hakosuka” (a blend of “hako” meaning “box” and “suka” from “Skyline”), was introduced in 1969 as a high-performance sports car targeted at the Japanese racing market. Equipped with a 2.0-liter S20 inline-six engine producing 160 horsepower, it quickly achieved over 50 wins in Japanese racing within its first three years.\nThe boxy, aggressive design gave it a unique look, which became iconic in Japanese car culture. Only 1,945 units of GT-R sedans and coupes were produced, making it rare and highly valuable among collectors. Its style influenced car enthusiasts and modders, who still admire the “Hakosuka” design.\nThis model was the first to carry the “GT-R” badge, paving the way for future racing models from Nissan. Although production ended in 1972, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 with the release of the Skyline R32, establishing the GT-R legacy as a symbol of Japanese engineering and performance.\nConclusion # I somewhat underestimated this kit from Tamiya. It’s very well-made, high-quality, and detailed. The contents of this kit are among the most complete, even including an additional figure 🤾‍♂️. I should have spent more time on it and done a higher-quality job. I recommend it, though perhaps not as a first kit (I’m sure it can turn out great on the first try, but the quality may not be fully appreciated). Careful work with photo-etching and thorough painting of all parts will yield an excellent and realistic model. I highly recommend it and may even assemble another variation of this beautiful car.\n","date":"4 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/car-blog/nissan-2000-gtr/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Nissan 2000 GT-R by Tamiya","type":"posts"},{"content":" BMW 2002: A Classic Icon # Overview # This model from Japanese manufacturer Hasegawa, according to ScaleMates, was first introduced in 2017. However, it feels like the molds for the parts were created in the ’90s or even earlier. This is evident from the fact that the clear parts for the windows, as well as the interior “tub,” are made as single pieces. The quality of the internal panel lines is poor and barely visible. Additionally, the chrome moldings lack grooves for proper positioning on the body. Although the kit may not appear very detailed at first glance (without an engine or a high-quality interior), the final result looks quite realistic. If assembled and painted correctly, the outcome will be excellent.\nFor those seeking maximum realism and detail, resin detail sets are available from USCP, nd modification videos for this kit can be found on YouTube.\nPrevious Next Assembly # The building process for this Hasegawa BMW 2002 Tii kit was straightforward. As mentioned earlier, the interior “bath” was a single piece, which simplified assembly but left much to be desired in terms of accuracy and realism. I assembled the model almost “out of the box” for simplicity but aimed to make it as clean as possible.\nThe body shell fit well with minimal sanding or adjustments needed. However, the chrome moldings required extra care due to the lack of positioning grooves, so I relied on reference images to ensure accurate placement. The suspension and undercarriage were assembled easily, with the engine already molded into the chassis. To highlight the detailing, it’s best to paint the engine, specifically its oil pan, in a separate color, and also to accent the wheel arches in a contrasting color. This results in a detailed model with eye-catching elements. Overall, while Japanese and some European model manufacturers may lack complete engine detailing, they compensate with quality parts that yield a realistic and engaging look.\nPainting # For painting, I used various types of paint (water-based acrylic, lacquer paints, and enamels).\nMr. Color 100 Wine Red for the body, applied over Vallejo black primer. Seats - Vallejo Model Color: Leather Brown (70.871) and Vallejo Game Color: Elfic Flesh (72.098) for the interior. Body clear coating - 2-3 layers of Mr. Color GX 100. Tamiya X-11 (enamel) for chrome details. My favorite Vallejo acrylic metallic - Metal Color: Pale Burnt Metal (77.704) for the engine and exhaust. All weathering effects were applied to the underside of the car, including oil stains, yellow rust, black and brown washes, all from Tamiya. Using the dry brush technique (silver metallic) over black primer highlighted the metallic parts of the car. For this, I use budget ICM Silver. Once satisfied with the result, I cover the part with semi-gloss varnish, giving a realistic look to the suspension, fuel tank, and other components of the car’s underside.\nI polish the body lightly, with gentle wet sanding using fine-grit sandpaper, followed by polishing with Tamiya Polishing Compound Fine. I’m still improving my polishing and detailing skills, so I don’t spend much time on this. Occasionally, I sand through to the primer… Besides, it’s rare to see cars polished to a mirror finish on the streets. In my opinion, it doesn’t make sense to weather the underside and polish the body to a shine… Either make it perfect or make it “realistic.”\nHistorical Background # The BMW 2002 is a key model that helped establish BMW’s reputation for producing sporty, driver-focused cars. It came about when BMW\u0026rsquo;s product planner Helmut Werner Bönsch and M10 engine designer Alex von Falkenhausen both modified their 1600-2 cars with 2.0-liter engines. When they realized this, they submitted a proposal to the board, which aligned with American importer Max Hoffman\u0026rsquo;s request for a sportier model for the U.S. market, leading to the creation of the BMW 2002.\nThe 2002 came in several versions, including the base model with 100 PS and the more powerful 2002 ti, which produced 120 PS. In 1971, the ti was replaced by the fuel-injected 2002 tii, which boasted 130 PS and a top speed of 185 km/h. Convertible and Touring versions were also available, offering flexibility for different drivers.\nThe 2002 Turbo, launched in 1973, was Europe’s first turbocharged production car, generating 170 PS and a top speed of 211 km/h. Despite being launched during the oil crisis, it became a legend for its performance and distinctive design, featuring flared arches and motorsport stripes, with only 1,672 units produced.\nConclusion # The Hasegawa BMW 2002 Tii model is a well-designed kit that offers a satisfying assembly experience and excellent results, despite its dated design. Although it consists of relatively few parts and has some drawbacks, it can be built into a classy, realistic model. Overall, this is a great kit that rewards patience and creativity, with a straightforward assembly and minimal fit issues, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced modelers alike.\n","date":"1 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/car-blog/bmw-2002-tii/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"BMW 2002 tii (Late Version) by Hasegawa","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 Nov 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/european/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"European","type":"tags"},{"content":" Disclaimer # I started building car models in 2023 and never stopped.
