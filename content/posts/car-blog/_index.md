### Disclaimer
I started building car models in 2023 and never stopped. This blog is about simple builds and enjoying the process. My style is “Spray & Pray” — no perfection chasing, no rules. Every model is personal, even if the color never existed on a real car. Build it your way and enjoy the craft. I hope you enjoy my builds and those of others as unique pieces of craftsmanship. Peace!
