### Disclaimer
This is currently the main section of my blog and will be my primary focus for the foreseeable future. I started making car models in 2023 and have loved it ever since. My approach is what I call “Spray & Pray,” which is why I prefer my models to be simple and easy to build. Maybe you prefer wet sanding and multiple layers of polishing to achieve a mirror finish, but that’s not my way. Your model is entirely yours, so you can build it however you like — even if the body color never existed on a real car. I hope you enjoy my builds and those of others as unique pieces of craftsmanship. Peace!
