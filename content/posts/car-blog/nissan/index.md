## Nissan 2000 GT-R: A Timeless Legend

### Overview

The Nissan 2000 GT-R model is very popular among Japanese manufacturers. This Street-Custom Edition kit from Tamiya was released in 2014, though it was first introduced by the company back in 1997. This iconic car is available in various versions, including 5-door sedan, racing, stock, and custom versions, also represented by other brands. According to [ScaleMates](https://www.scalemates.com/uk/kits/tamiya-24194-nissan-skyline-2000-gt-r-hard-top--129389/timeline), models of this Nissan have been produced since 1979 (10 years after the real car’s release). The Tamiya Street-Custom Edition includes Watanabe wheels, an additional driver figure with accessories, and photo-etched parts. All details are clearly molded and well-detailed, matching Tamiya’s high product quality. The kit includes full engine detailing and an opening hood.

### Assembly

The assembly was enjoyable and smooth: all parts fit together nicely, are well-detailed, and the lines are precisely printed. The instructions are also straightforward. The kit includes optional engine parts (racing and stock), along with a photo-etched radiator that can be installed under the bumper. Initially, I installed it, but it didn’t look quite right since it protruded significantly below and didn’t align with the car’s overall style, so I removed it after assembly. Following the instructions and assembling carefully will lead to great results. I encountered a minor issue with the hood: the instructions suggested securing it with masking tape during assembly, but I likely didn’t do a pre-fit, so after painting, the hood doesn’t fully close. This can be corrected and repainted, but for now, I’ve left it as is. The kit also includes metal stickers for extra detailing. The front and rear emblems can be added as decals or photo-etching — I chose photo-etching for a more realistic look. The photo-etched license plate frame (a plastic one is also included) looks great with transparent number decals.

### Painting

When I bought this kit, I didn’t have much enthusiasm for it, to be honest, I bought it for a good price. Therefore, I didn’t want to complicate the painting process too much. The main color for this model is Vallejo Metal Color: Pale Burnt Metal (77.704), which I used to paint the body, engine, and parts of the exhaust system. To make the metallic paint look different on various parts, I used different primers: gray Vallejo for the body and black for the engine and exhaust system, applying varying numbers of layers. I managed to achieve a pleasant gray metallic finish on the body, covered with 2-3 coats of Mr. Color GX100 lacquer. The window frames and chrome details were painted with Tamiya X-11 chrome marker. The suspension parts were dry-brushed with ICM Silver. The interior was painted in a two-tone scheme—black and brown, using Vallejo acrylics. For weathering, I used Tamiya black wash and their weathering powder to add oil stains and rust effects.

### Historical Background

The Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R, also known as “Hakosuka” (a blend of “hako” meaning “box” and “suka” from “Skyline”), was introduced in 1969 as a high-performance sports car targeted at the Japanese racing market. Equipped with a 2.0-liter S20 inline-six engine producing 160 horsepower, it quickly achieved over 50 wins in Japanese racing within its first three years.

The boxy, aggressive design gave it a unique look, which became iconic in Japanese car culture. Only 1,945 units of GT-R sedans and coupes were produced, making it rare and highly valuable among collectors. Its style influenced car enthusiasts and modders, who still admire the “Hakosuka” design.

This model was the first to carry the “GT-R” badge, paving the way for future racing models from Nissan. Although production ended in 1972, the GT-R name was revived in 1989 with the release of the Skyline R32, establishing the GT-R legacy as a symbol of Japanese engineering and performance.

### Conclusion

I somewhat underestimated this kit from Tamiya. It’s very well-made, high-quality, and detailed. The contents of this kit are among the most complete, even including an additional figure. I should have spent more time on it and done a higher-quality job. I recommend it, though perhaps not as a first kit (I’m sure it can turn out great on the first try, but the quality may not be fully appreciated). Careful work with photo-etching and thorough painting of all parts will yield an excellent and realistic model. I highly recommend it and may even assemble another variation of this beautiful car.
