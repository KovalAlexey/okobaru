## Aoshima – Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE86 (Initial D Comic Version)

### Overview

This is the Aoshima 1/24 scale model of the Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE86, based on the Initial D manga and anime series. This particular version—the “Comic Version”—mimics the black-and-white appearance of the original manga panels. This is a well-made kit with excellent engineering and part fit. Many builders report minimal cleanup, crisp panel lines, and precision in bumper and body alignment. Reddit users praise the "separate bumpers construction method" and working pop-up headlights as highlights of the assembly experience 

From my experience:

Body panels and bumpers align tightly with no filler needed

Headlights are molded closed but fit cleanly—no shifting or gaps

Plastic is softish but well-molded; sharper sprue gates than other brands

### 🎯 Build Tips
Dry-fit suspension first – Even with excellent fit, the low ride height can push joins apart if glued untested. A light cement dab secures parts without fuss.

Masking the "panda" scheme – Use sharp tape and multiple thin layers. Panel shading lines are raised, so mask just above them for clean white/black separation.

White primer boosts contrast – Your choice of Mr. Hobby alcohol-based white primer was ideal, helping black lines pop and reducing paint layers needed.

Use decal softener – Comic decals are thick; setting solution helps them mold to curves, especially over rear fender areas. 

Simplify interior painting – A brown interior reflects the anime’s palette, and sticking to matte/semi-gloss finishes is both accurate and fuss-free.

### Painting

When I bought this kit, I wasn’t particularly enthusiastic about building it—honestly, I got it mainly because it was a great deal. So, I didn’t plan to go deep into details during painting. For the main color of this model, I chose Vallejo Metal Color: Pale Burnt Metal (77.704), which I used for the body, engine, and parts of the exhaust system. To achieve a different metallic look on various parts, I used different primers: Vallejo gray for the body and black for the engine and exhaust, also applying varying numbers of layers. This resulted in a pleasant gray metallic on the body, which I cover with 2–3 layers of Mr. Color GX100 clear coat. The window frames and chrome parts were painted with a Tamiya X-11 marker. Suspension parts were “dry brushed” using ICM Silver. The interior was done in a two-tone scheme—black and brown Vallejo acrylic. For weathering, I applied Tamiya black wash and their powder to create effects of oil stains and traces of rust.

### Historical Background

The Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno was produced from 1983 to 1987 and became iconic in Japan’s street racing scene due to its lightweight chassis, rear-wheel-drive layout, and balanced handling. It wasn’t a fast car by modern standards, but it was precise—and that made it perfect for mountain roads.

The car gained legendary status thanks to the manga and anime series Initial D, where teenage driver Takumi Fujiwara uses it to deliver tofu and unknowingly becomes one of the most skilled street racers on Mount Akina. Over time, the AE86 became a symbol of grassroots motorsport and drift culture, influencing a whole generation of drivers and enthusiasts.

Even today, the AE86 is celebrated in games like Gran Turismo and Forza, and it remains a cult favorite among tuners and collectors.

### Conclusion

This kit is a pleasure to build. Fit and finish are excellent, and it requires minimal modification or cleanup. The unique visual style offers a welcome break from traditional hyper-realistic models and makes for a standout shelf piece—especially for fans of Initial D or stylized manga kits.

Despite its simple curbside construction, the model offers enough detail and style to be satisfying even for experienced builders. I highly recommend this kit to anyone looking to build something different but meaningful.
